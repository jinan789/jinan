# Log in as user `dev`

_Difficulty:_ Easy

Developers use an account with the username `dev` to perform quality assurance
testing on UnicornBox. Fortunately for us, they're sloppy and haven't cleaned up
any leftover comments before releasing UnicornBox. See if you can find a way to
get `dev`'s password and log in.

**Your task:** Log in as user `dev` through the login page. Note that gaining
access to `dev`'s account through other means will not satisfy this flag.
