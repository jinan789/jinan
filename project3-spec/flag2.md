# Change the text of `ip.txt`

_Difficulty:_ Easy

The `cs161` user is using UnicornBox to store a file called `ip.txt`. `cs161`
is a special-purpose account on UnicornBox. It uses a separate login mechanism,
so you won't be able to log in as `cs161`, but you may still be able to change
some of its files.

**Your task:** Change the contents of `cs161` user's `ip.txt` file to be
`161.161.161.161`.
