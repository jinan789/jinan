# Gain access to the admin panel

_Difficulty:_ Hard

UnicornBox has a special panel for administrators. Your final task is to log
into the admin panel.

Password authentication for the admin panel is handled separately from the
database. However, the administrator does use UnicornBox for day-to-day file
storage, so they may also have a normal user account.

**Your task:** Gain access to the admin panel.

_Tip:_ Neither `nicholas` nor `shomil` are administrators of the site. Your
first step might be to figure out the username of the administrator.

_Tip:_ Consider human factors. Many people reuse passwords.

_Tip:_ We recommend completing Flag 3 before trying this flag.
